MS Azure Credentials Harvesting Google Dorks

Some Google dorks for MS Azure credentials harvesting.
Deliberately kept them simple (without OR, AND, etc) to minimize Google confusion.
The dorks take into account this book recommendations: https://www.amazon.com/Pentesting-Azure-Applications-Definitive-Deployments/dp/1593278632 and other sources.
In real pentests - add target company/project name/domain to the intext: section.
